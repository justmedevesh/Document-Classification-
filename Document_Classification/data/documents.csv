1,"China says its economy grew by 5% last year, meeting Beijing's official target as a record trade surplus boosted growth.",Business
2,"But Chinese government figures also showed economic growth slowed to 4.5% in the final three months of 2025, compared to a year earlier.",Business
3,"Beijing had set a goal of ""around 5%"" economic growth in 2025, despite struggles to boost domestic spending, a prolonged property crisis and the turmoil caused by US President Donald Trump's tariff policies.",Business
4,"Experts say the figures point to a ""two-speed economy"", with manufacturing and exports propping up growth, while within the country, people are still spending cautiously and the property market continues to weigh on the economy.",Business
5,"While the headline [gross domestic product] print came in at 5% for 2025, matching the government's target, we think growth is weaker than official figures suggest,"" said Zichun Huang, China Economist at Capital Economics.",Business
6,"Huang added that her company's own calculations suggest China's official growth figures ""overstate the pace of economic expansion"" by at least 1.5 percentage points.",Business
7,"Also on Monday, Chinese data showed the country registered the lowest number of births last year since records began in 1949.",Business
8,"The total number of births dropped to 7.9 million in 2025, figures from China's National Bureau of Statistics showed.",Business
9,"Economists say the falling birth rate will compound domestic challenges by weakening demand for housing and consumer goods, adding pressure to an already struggling property market.",Business
10,"Officials said the country's population declined for a fourth year in row 2025, falling 3.4 million to 1.4 billion.",Business
11,The figures highlight China's deepening demographic crisis even as the government tries to boost birth rates by offering couples incentives to have more children,Business
12,"China reported the world's largest-ever trade surplus last week - the value of goods and services sold overseas compared to its imports - of $1.19tn (£890bn), driven by a rise in exports to markets outside the US.",Business
13,"China is effectively pushing growth through exports at a loss, and that is not sustainable. Cutting prices may keep volumes up, but it undermines profits and, ultimately, growth,"" Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at French bank Natixis, told the BBC.",Business
14,"Speaking on Monday, Kang Yi, head of China's National Bureau of Statistics, said the country's economy ""faces problems and challenges, including strong supply and weak demand"", but added that it will be able to ""maintain stable, sound growth momentum this year",Business
15,"Analysts warn that growing reliance on exports leaves China more exposed to global trade tensions, especially as uncertainty grows over US tariff policy.",Business
16,The US president recently threatened to impose new levies on countries that trade with Iran or oppose his plan to take control of Greenland.,Business
17,China and other Asian nations buy oil from Iran.,Business
18,"China's economic resilience could be a result of lower than expected US tariffs, after Beijing and Washington agreed a pause, but that is due to expire in November 2026.",Business
19,Nowhere are China's domestic challenges more visible than in its property sector.,Business
20,"Beijing has been grappling with a prolonged housing downturn, and rising local government debt, making businesses more hesitant to invest to expand, and consumers more cautious about spending.",Business
21,"New data on Monday showed that house prices continued to fall in December, as the government struggled to stabilise China's property market.",Business
22,"Prices dropped 2.7% last month compared to a year earlier, the sharpest decline in five months. Property investment also fell 17.2% last year.",Business
23,"The prolonged property slump has had such a major impact because the real estate industry once accounted for about a quarter of China's economy, hitting construction activity household wealth and local government finances.",Business
24,"Millions of households have been left with unfinished homes or properties that have lost significant value, undermining confidence in what was once seen as the safest place to store savings.",Business
25,Falling land sales have also squeezed local government revenues.,Business
26,"China's reported GDP of 5% is not surprising given the political incentives to ensure headline stability, but this clearly masks the horrible investment data,"" said Louise Loo, Head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics.",Business
27,"Retail sales rose just 0.9% in December, the slowest pace in three years, although factory output increased to 5.2% beating November's 4.8% growth.",Business
28,"Once the 5% economic growth target was secured, policymakers appeared to hold back additional stimulus, effectively saving resources for this year, Natixis said in a note after the release of the data.",Business
29,Economists from the bank added that the slowdown in retail sales and investment late in the year reflected policy timing rather than a sudden deterioration in the economy.,Business
30,"Chinese leaders have pledged ""proactive"" policies this year as they look to shore up confidence among consumers and businesses. But the data suggests the underlying economy remains fragile",Business
31,"Beijing faces a delicate balancing act between reviving growth through stimulus while containing rising debt, and finding ways to avoid reliance on exports in an increasingly uncertain trade environment.",Business
32,"As President Donald Trump continues to insist that the US needs to own Greenland, his wider focus on the Arctic region has seen Washington order new icebreakers",Business
33,"For these ships, which can sail through seas covered in solid ice, the US has gone to the world expert – Finland.",Business
34,"Temperatures are sub-zero inside Aker Arctic Technology's ice laboratory, as the scale model of an icebreaker cruises down a 70m-long simulation tank.",Business
35,"Undergoing testing at a facility in Helsinki, Finland's capital, this is a design for the next generation of the country's icebreakers.",Business
36,"""It's crucial that it has sufficient structural strength and engine power,"" says ice performance engineer, Riikka Matala.",Business
37,"Mika Hovilainen, the firm's chief executive, adds that the shape of the vessel is also crucial. ""You have to have a hull form that breaks ice by bending it downwards,"" he says. ""It's not cutting, it's not slicing",Business
38,"The country leads the way out of necessity, explains Maunu Visuri, president and chief executive of Finnish state-owned company Artica, which operates a fleet of eight icebreakers.",Business
39,"""Finland is the only country in the world where all the harbours may freeze during wintertime,"" he says, adding that 97% of all goods to the country are imported by sea.",Business
40,"During the coldest months, icebreakers keep Finland's ports open, and work as pathfinders for big cargo ships. ""It's really a necessity for Finland. We say that Finland is an island.""",Business
41,"A further seven of the vessels, which the US is calling ""Arctic Security Cutters"", are to be built in the US, using Finnish designs and expertise.",Business
42,"""We're buying the finest icebreakers in the world, and Finland is known for making them,"" said Trump.",Business
43,"This US concern comes as climate change continues to make the Arctic Ocean more navigable for cargo ships, at least if icebreakers lead the way by cutting a path. This opens up commercial trade routes from Asia to Europe, either above Russia, or north of Alaska and Canada's mainland, and down past Greenland.",Business
44,Reduced ice levels also mean that oil and gas fields beneath the Arctic are more accessible.,Business
45,"""There's simply a lot more traffic in that part of the world now,"" notes Peter Rybski, a retired US Navy officer and Helsinki-based, Arctic expert.",Business
46,"""You have an active oil and gas exploration and extraction industry in Russia, as well as a newly-emerging trans-shipment route from Europe to Asia.""",Business
47,Finland's Rauma Marine Constructions is to build two icebreakers for the US Coast Guard at its shipyard in the Finnish port of Rauma. The first ship is due to be delivered in 2028.,Business
48,"A further four will be constructed in Louisiana, with all six using an Aker Arctic Technology diesel-electric powered design.",Business
49,"The US orders are part of an effort to catch up with the number of Russian icebreakers. Currently Russia has around 40, including eight that are nuclear powered.",Business
50,"By contrast, the US presently only has three in operation.",Business
51,"Meanwhile China operates around five polar-capable vessels. ""None of them are technically icebreakers,"" says Rybski, pointing to their design not meeting the strict criteria. ""But they are increasing their fleet.""",Business
52,"Trump's desire to enlarge its icebreaker fleet goes beyond the practicalities of operating in ice-clad Arctic seas, assesses Lin Mortensgaard, a researcher at the Danish Institute of International Studies. She says it is also about projecting power.",Business
53,"""No matter how many aircraft carriers you have and how much you use them to threaten states with, you cannot sail your aircraft carrier into the central Arctic Ocean,"" she says.",Business
54,"""Icebreakers are really the only kind of naval vessel to signal that you are an Arctic state, with Arctic capabilities. And I think this is what much of the US discourse is about.",Business
55,"Back in Finland, Helsinki Shipyard occupies a dock on the capital's waterfront. It is where half of the world's icebreakers have been made. Today owned by Canadian firm Davie, it also hopes to win new contracts from the US Coast Guard.",Business
56,"""The geopolitical situation has changed definitely,"" says the shipyard's managing director, Kim Salmi.",Business
57,"""We have our eastern neighbour here [Russia]. They are building their own [new] fleet. And the Chinese are building their fleet.""",Business
58,"He adds: ""The US, Canada and the western allies in general, are looking for the power balance.""",Business
59,"Inside a cavernous shipbuilding hangar, workers cut and weld steel for the yard's latest icebreaker, a heavy-duty Arctic vessel, called Polarmax that's destined for the Canadian coastguard.",Business
60,"The Finns can build these complex vessels remarkably swiftly - it takes between two-and-a-half and three years - thanks to a streamlined production method, and decades of experience.",Business
61,"""Over 100 years, we have practised this,"" says Artica's Visuri. ""You've got this cycle of designers, operators, builders. That's why Finland is the superpower of icebreakers.""",Business
62,"Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Canadian PM Mark Carney have announced lower tariffs, signalling a reset in their countries' relationship after a key meeting in Beijing.",Business
63,"China is expected to lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by 1 March, while Ottawa has agreed to tax Chinese electric vehicles at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1%, Carney told reporters. ",Business
64,"The deal is a breakthrough after years of strained ties and tit-for-tat levies. Xi hailed the ""turnaround"" in their relationship but it is also a win for Carney, the first Canadian leader to visit China in nearly a decade. ",Business
65,"He has been trying to diversify Canadian trade away from the US, his country's biggest trading partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs.",Business
66,"The deal could also see more Chinese investments in Canada, right on America's doorstep. ",Business
67,"Carney himself seemed to allude to the fact that this was a result of Trump's tariffs, which have now pushed one of the US's key allies towards its biggest rival. ",Business
68,"He told reporters that Canada's relationship with China had been more ""predictable"" in recent months and that he found talks with Beijing ""realistic and respectful"".",Business
69,"He also made clear Ottawa does not agree with Beijing on everything, adding that in his discussions with Xi he made clear Canada's ""red lines"", including human rights, concerns over election interference and the need for ""guardrails"".",Business
70,"""We take the world as it is - not as we wish it to be,"" he said when asked about China's human rights record.",Business
71,Observers believe Carney's visit could set an example for other countries across the world who are also feeling the pain from Washington's tariffs. ,Business
72,"In contrast, Xi has been trying to show that China is a stable global partner and has been urging more pragmatic ties - in the words of Beijing, ""a win-win"" for all.",Business
73,And it seems to be working. The South Korean president and the Irish prime minister have both visited Beijing in recent weeks. The UK prime minister is expected to visit soon and so is the German Chancellor.,Business
74,"Carney said the ""world has changed dramatically"" and how Canada positions itself ""will shape our future for decades to come,"" he added. ",Business
75,"Earlier in his three-day visit, he had said that the Canada-China partnership sets the two countries up for a ""new world order"". He later added that the multilateral system had been ""eroded, to use a polite term, or undercut"". ",Business
76,"As the Chinese and Canadian delegations sat down in the Great Hall of the People on Friday, Xi said: ""The healthy and stable development of China-Canada relations is conducive to world peace, stability, development, and prosperity.""",Business
77,"In November 2025, India approved a 73bn-rupee ($800m; £600m) plan that could help it to cut its dependence on China in one of the most strategic corners of the global supply chain: rare earth magnets.",Business
78,"These small but powerful components sit at the heart of modern life - used in everything from electric vehicles and wind turbines to smartphones, medical scanners, and defence equipment. ",Business
79,"Developing a full rare earths ecosystem is expensive, complex and time-consuming. By focusing on magnets instead, one of the most widely used rare-earth products, India aims to achieve self-reliance more quickly. ",Business
80,"But its success will depend on how fast the country can master technology, secure materials and scale up, experts say. ",Business
81,"For one, it lacks industrial expertise. Countries such as Japan, South Korea and Germany have spent years refining magnet-making technology. India in comparison has virtually no commercial-scale experience, experts say.",Business
82,"""This is a good step in the right direction, but it's only a start,"" says Neha Mukherjee of Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a consulting firm that deals with batteries and rare earth elements. ""India will need strategic partnerships to import technology, skill up its workforce and then build its own capabilities.""",Business
83,"Dr PV Sunder Raju, chief scientist at the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI), echoed the concern. ",Business
84,"""It's not possible to just give 73bn rupees and expect a product without a strong background in research and development,"" he said.",Business
85,"There is also the question of raw materials. India holds the world's third-largest, rare earth reserves, about 8% of the global total, largely in the sands of coastal states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat. Yet it accounts for less than 1% of global mining.",Business
86,"But even if it does manage to tap into its own rare earth reserves, it has only some of the elements needed to make magnets.",Business
87,"That raises the question: even if magnets are made in India, will the raw materials still come from China?",Business
88,"There are also concerns around the scale of this operation. India already consumes an estimated 7,000 tonnes of magnets a year, Ms Mukherjee says. Producing 6,000 tonnes by the early 2030s may still leave the country short - and exposed - as demand continues to accelerate.",Business
89,"""If we do not scale capacity, the problem doesn't get solved. We'll still be dependent on China - and China will scale,"" Ms Mukherjee explains. ",Business
90,"Experts also point out that another challenge will be to price domestically made magnets in a way that they don't get undercut by imports. Chinese magnets are cheap and, unless Indian-made alternatives are competitively priced, imports could continue to dominate.",Business
91,"The solution, some argue, may lie in incentives not just for manufacturers but for buyers as well.",Business
92,"""The hope is that Indian players will continue to put in their entrepreneurial energy and get the ecosystem going,"" Mr Gupta says.",Business
93,"Despite the challenges, the introduction of the scheme is a recognition of India's ambition to bolster its own rare earth ecosystem, and that's worthwhile, he adds.",Business

223,"Cuffing season refers to this idea that mating behaviours are seasonal,"" says Christine Ma-Kellams, associate professor of psychology at San Jose State University in California.

However, there have been no recent studies that can suggest this trend is ongoing.",Health

226,"Emerging research suggests that the communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that make up our body's microbiota can influence our sleep. Depending on the composition of our personal microbial ecosystem, the amount of shut eye we get can either improve or deteriorate.",Health
227,"And tantalisingly, it could offer new ways of tackling sleep-related conditions caused by a disrupted body clock, described by sleep scientists as circadian rhythms. While many people currently rely on sleeping pills to quell persistent insomnia, the future might see friendly bacteria deployed to help us nod off, and even address obstructive sleep apnoea, a condition in which people struggle to breathe normally while asleep.",Health
228,"Circadian rhythm disruption occurs in people who stay up later and sleep in on the weekends, those who work long hours, like first responders, police and security, paramedics and the military, and in people who eat too close to bedtime,"" says Kenneth Wright, a professor of integrative physiology at the University of Colorado Boulder in the US. ""This can cause gastrointestinal disturbances and metabolic diseases, which are common for example in shift workers, and a disturbed microbiome may play a role.",Health
229,"Part of the theory behind this is that when you've had a bad night's sleep, the reward centres in your brain are heightened the next day, and so you seek out that quick fix,"" she says. ""Your brain is kind of tricking you into feeling, 'Ok, I need refined carbohydrates', to get that quick burst of energy.",Health
230,But changing dietary patterns in response to sleep deprivation is not the whole story. Berry and her colleagues found nine species that were greater in abundance and eight that were less abundant in people with social jet lag compared to those without this variation in sleep patterns. But they found that diet appeared to only account for changes in abundance for four of these microbe species.,Health
231,"Jaime Tartar, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Nova Southeastern University in Florida who was not involved in the Zoe study, says she has become increasingly convinced that certain microbes play a direct role in sleep.",Health
232,"In some cases, sleep disruptions might actively drive shifts in these microbial populations through impairing the immune system and its ability to regulate microbes, which could in turn increase the likelihood of longer-term sleep problems. ",Health
233,"But researchers including Tartar and Martin suggest that some sleep problems could also be initiated by microbial imbalances in the gut or mouth. They believe that certain bacteria may actively alter the quality of the sleep we get by shifting our circadian rhythms – the internal body clock that governs our sleep – and altering our food intake, which also impacts the kip we get.",Health
234,"Changes in the balance of our gut microbes may also alter the amounts of useful chemicals they produce as they help to break down our food. This in turn can influence sleep quality, says Tartar.",Health
235,"Martin, while intrigued by such results, emphasises the need for larger, more robust trials that compare prebiotic or probiotic interventions to existing treatments, which are already known to be effective for tackling sleep problems. That includes cognitive behavioural therapy (a type of talk therapy often reffered to as CBT) and various medications.",Health

240,"How old do you think your lungs are? With every breath, they are exposed to a myriad of pollutants, microbes, dust and allergens. Unsurprisingly this can take a toll on these delicate organs, accelerating how they age. But they also can affect how the rest of your body ages too. ",Health
241,"The better your lung capacity is at this peak age, however, the more resilience you will have against chronic respiratory diseases and other lung-related health conditions later in life, says Garcia-Aymerich. But lung health is also linked to a wide range of other more surprising aspects of your health, affecting your immune system, your weight and even your brain (read on to find out why later in this piece).",Health
242,So just how healthy are your lungs? And can you do anything to improve the state they are in? ,Health
243,"Studies like the one described above use expensive equipment to measure lung health, but there is a simple way to test your lungs at home. All you need is a large plastic bottle, a bucket or bathtub and a length of rubber tubing. And then do the following (you might want to do it in a sink or outside as it can get a bit messy):",Health
244,"1. First, measure out 200ml (7fl oz) of water into a measuring jug, transfer to the plastic bottle and use a pen to mark the water level.",Health
245,"2. Add another 200ml of water, mark the new water level and repeat the process until the bottle is full.",Health
246,"3. Fill the bucket or bathtub with water and dip the now full bottle into it, turning the bottle upside down under the water.",Health
247,"4. Keeping the bottle in this position, place the rubber tubing inside the bottle neck. It doesn't have to fit tightly.",Health
248,5. Take a deep breath and blow into the tube.,Health
249,6. Count how many lines of water you can blow out of the bottle.,Health
250,"7. Multiply the number of lines by 200ml. (eg three lines is 600ml). This number is your vital lung capacity, also referred to as forced vital capacity or FVC.",Health
251,"The test looks at the volume of air you can breathe out, which has been termed vital [lung] capacity,"" says John Dickinson, who heads the exercise respiratory clinic at the University of Kent. ""This term was first used by English surgeon John Hutchinson in the 1840s. He started to notice that those who could only breath small volumes of air had less time to live.",Health
252,"Dickinson says that you should not be overly concerned if you get a lower reading from this home health test. ""A lot of people will struggle to completely empty their lungs so may get false low readings,"" he says. ",Health
253,"But there are also ways of improving your lung health and combating any decline in their performance. And if you want to age gracefully, this may be a vital step",Health
254,"""The lung has millions and millions of immune cells that have important functions like clearing particulate air pollution, fighting infections, and repairing the damage that comes from the constant stretching of breathing in and out,"" she says.",Health
255,"The relationship between our lungs and wider health is also two-way. Bowdish says that if we keep our lungs relatively healthy, we are more likely to remain disease free for longer in later life.",Health
256,"""Even though lung capacity declines with age, this is not a cause for concern for those who look after their lung health,"" adds Dickinson. ""Healthy lungs have more than enough capacity to supply the body with oxygen and remove carbon dioxide throughout the lifespan. However, if the rate of decline increases, our health and quality of life may be impacted.",Health
257,"Once you know the state of your lungs, evidence shows there are some preventative steps which you can take to improve your lung capacity and help mitigate age-related decline. ",Health
258,"Sabrina Brar, medical officer at Powerbreathe International, compares carrying out IMT through the device to weightlifting for your arm and leg muscles. ""Strengthening the muscles responsible for breathing in, much like strengthening any other muscle in the body, will increase respiratory muscle endurance and strength and reduce age-related lung function decline,"" says Brar. ""The idea is to engage the diaphragm and intercostal muscles and then periodically increase the resistance over time as lung strength improves.""",Health
259,"While Kaasgaard says that there is no evidence to suggest that singing can actually reverse existing lung damage, she believes that it might still benefit lung health by improving our ability to utilise our respiratory muscles.",Health
260,"A central aspect of singing is the ability to sing long phrases, which requires control and flexibility of the diaphragm, the muscles in between the ribs and the abdominal muscles,"" she says.",Health
261,"But whichever lung workout you choose, it can help these vital organs cope with all the world throws at them – one breath at a time.",Health
262,"Although it is normal for people to walk more slowly as they age, a precipitous decline in the speed of someone's gait could indicate that something more serious is going on.",Health
263,"""When a person's normal walking pace declines, it is often associated with underlying health declines,"" says Christina Dieli-Conwright, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who studies the effects of exercise on cancer prognosis. ",Health
264,"""It might be that the person has a chronic condition which has meant that they haven't been moving as much or have become sedentary. That means that, more than likely, they've experienced a decrease in muscle strength, and joint mobility, which unfortunately leads to further health declines,"" says Dieli-Conwright.",Health
265,"If you are outside and you have lots of space, you could try the 10m (33ft) walking speed test. First, measure out 5m (16.5ft), followed by another 10m. To get started, it's recommended to walk for 5m to get up to your normal speed, then walk at your normal pace for 10m. To calculate your walking speed simply divide 10m by the number of seconds it took to walk that distance.",Health
266,"If you're at home and space is more limited, you could try the 4m (13.2ft) walking speed test. With this test, measure out 1m (3.3ft), followed by 4m. The idea is to use the first metre to get up to speed, then time how long it takes to walk for 4m at your usual pace. To work out your speed, divide four metres by the number of seconds it took you to walk that distance.",Health
267,"Alternatively, there are many apps you can use to measure your walking speed, including fitness trackers like Walkmeter, MapMyWalk, Strava, and Google Fit, which use GPS to track distance and time, allowing them to calculate your speed. ",Health
268,"""Walking seems like such a simple thing – most of us don't think about it, we just do it,"" says Line Rasmussen, a senior researcher in the department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Duke University, North Carolina.",Health
269,"But walking actually relies on many different body systems working together: your bones and muscles carry and move you, your eyes help you see where you're going, your heart and lungs circulate blood and oxygen, and your brain and nerves coordinate it all,"" Rasmussen adds.",Health
270,"According to Rasmussen, as we age, the function of these systems starts to slow down – and a slower walking speed can therefore reflect this overall decline and be a sign of advanced ageing.",Health
271,"""I was surprised by how much variation there was in walking speed among people who were all the same age,"" says Rasmussen. ""You might expect everyone at 45 to be somewhere in the middle, but some walked as quickly as healthy 20-year-olds, while others walked as slowly as much older adults,"" she says.",Health
272,"Rasmussen and colleagues also found that slow walkers showed signs of advanced cognitive ageing. For example, they tended to score lower on IQ tests overall, performing worse on tests of memory, processing speed, reasoning and other cognitive functions. MRI scans also showed that this cognitive deterioration was accompanied by observable changes in the participants' brains. Slower walkers had smaller brains, a thinner neocortex – the outermost layer of the brain, which controls thinking and higher information processing – and more white matter. Intriguingly, even the faces of slow walkers were rated as ageing at a faster rate than the other participants.",Health
273,"You might start to notice it as early as your thirties: the dull knee aches when the weather changes, the morning stiffness when you get out of bed. You might think twice about crouching down. They're all unwelcome signs that your knees are not quite the well-oiled joints they once were.",Health
274,"The knee is one of the most complex joints in the entire body,"" says Anikar Chhabra, an orthopaedic surgeon and chair of sports medicine at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, US. ""It bears the full load of our body weight with every step we take.""",Health
275,"There are assorted reasons for focusing on your knee health that can bring benefits both now and later in life, and a number of simple steps which we can all take to stay as mobile as possible for longer. ",Health
276,"Our knees rely heavily on four surrounding muscle groups – the hamstrings, the gluteal muscles, the quadriceps muscles and the calf muscles. These support the knee and provide it with the stability and shock absorption capability that enables it to function. ",Health
277,"""When these muscles aren't interacting and working together, that's when you put more stress on the joint,"" says Chhabra. ""That's what leads to pain.""",Health
278,"""There's like a motor oil on the inside of our knees called synovial fluid,"" she says. ""Exercise helps stimulate production of it, which decreases stiffness and inflammation, and helps with lubricating the cartilage surface."" ",Health
279,"Knee exercises help with this awareness,"" says Chhabra. ""It's really getting your mind to connect to your knee which again will decrease risk of falls."" ",Health
280,"To keep the important muscle groups strong, Chhabra suggests spending 15 minutes a day, three to four times per week on various knee exercises listed below, all of which you can do at home without the need for any specialised equipment. He also recommends speaking to a physio or a strength coach first to ensure you are performing them correctly.",Health
281,"""That's when you start to very slowly lose muscle mass and bone density so that would be a good time to focus on it, if you don't have strengthening as part of your regular exercise programme,"" she says",Health
282,"Calf raises are one of the best ways of strengthening these muscles, according to Chhabra. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointing forward, and raise your heels slowly while keeping your knees extended, before holding for one second on the tips of your toes and then lowering again.",Health
283,"Calf raises help to improve the muscle balance around your knee so that they all work well together, he says. ""If one muscle is weak, you're going to have an imbalance which will put more strain on the knee.""",Health
284,"This one works the core muscles deep within in your abdomen, back and pelvis. While they might not appear to be directly related, Colvin says that this large muscle group plays a somewhat underrated role in maintaining knee health. ""Your core muscles really go from your mid chest down to your knee,"" she says.",Health
285,Simply sit in a chair and repeatedly stand up and sit back down again without holding onto anything.,Health
286,"If you're new to doing these kinds of exercises, Chhabra recommends booking an initial appointment with either a physio or a strength and conditioning coach to first practice each one with them, to ensure you're doing it correctly, and determine exactly how many sets and repetitions are appropriate for you.",Health
287,"As you get stronger, you can certainly add weight, by doing some of these exercises wearing weighted vests, or holding weights if you have access to them, but that also depends on your age and your strength level,"" he says. ""As we get older, body weight alone tends to be best. I also tell patients to monitor worsening pain. Muscle soreness is normal, but worsening pain in the joints is not good, as that indicates something going on inside the knee that needs to be seen by a doctor.""",Health
288,"Overall, taking the time to do knee strengthening exercises serves as a valuable investment in your long-term health. We might take our knees for granted, but they let us walk, skip, jump and run, until they fail. As Baz Luhrmann wisely advised in the song Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen): ""Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when they're gone.""",Health
289,"These signals come from different parts of out gut and work over slightly different time frames,"" says Tony Goldstone, clinical associate professor at Imperial College London and consultant endocrinologist.",Health
290,"This cascade of hormones released from the gut and pancreas and sending signals to the brain may also have something to do with the sleepy feeling we get after a big meal (called ""postprandial somnolence""). But the exact mechanisms behind this are not yet well-understood, says Aaron Hengist, a postdoctoral visiting fellow at the National Institutes of Health in Washington, US",Health
291,"Fourteen healthy men (very bravely) volunteered to eat lots of pizza in one sitting. In one study visit they were asked to eat until they were comfortably full, and in the other study visit, as much as they could. They ate double the amount of pizza in the all-you-can-eat experiment.",Health
292,"Their hormones, appetite, mood and metabolic responses were measured for four hours following their feasts. The researchers found that their blood sugar levels were no higher than after a normal meal, and neither was the amount of fat in their blood",Health
293,"""We were surprised that, despite double the energy intake, the body regulated blood sugar remarkably well,"" says Hengist. ""We found that the body was working hard to do this, by secreting more insulin and various gut hormones that help release insulin and signal that we're full.""",Health
294,"This study shows, he says, that a one-off indulgence is not as damaging as you might expect.",Health
295,"However, since the study was only done in young healthy men, the research can't be extrapolated to the general population without first studying women and people who are overweight or obese, says Hengist.",Health
296,"While one pizza-eating session may not be immediately harmful, there is some research showing that multiple hours or one day of feasting can start to disrupt metabolism and put strain on the body, which could, in turn, affect the brain",Health
297,"The researchers tried to replicate this tradition by giving 18 overweight but healthy men alcoholic drinks and high fatty, sugary foods including burgers, chips and cake, to consume over an afternoon. They ate an average of 5,087 calories over the five hours. Blood tests and a liver scan revealed that most of the men had increased fat in the liver following their feasts.",Health
298,"The 'tailgate' study shows the men had metabolic dysregulation. When passively consuming food and alcohol over multiple hours, it's too much strain for their bodies to deal with,"" Hengist says.",Health
299,Evolution may go some way to understanding why it may not be too harmful to overeat once in a while – and how our guts and brains have evolved to communicate with each other when we need to eat.,Health
300,"The hunger made them seek food, and once they found it, that behaviour doesn't need to continue,"" Goldstone says.",Health
301,"Much of this process, Goldstone adds, goes on subconsciously.",Health
302,"Humans have evolved to find ways to cope with starvation, because without food, we'd die. But excess, throughout human history, didn't happen – and its effects are longer term and less lethal, at least in in the short term, says Goldstone",Health
303,"One study, however, gives some insight into what happens in our brains when we overeat food high in sugar and fat. It wasn't quite reduced to one meal, but lasted for five days. However, its findings could potentially be applied to a lesser extent to shorter periods of overeating, according to Kullmann.",Health
